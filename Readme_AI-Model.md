
# Reinforcement Learning (RL)  ==>  Area of ML concerned with how softw. AGENTS ought to take action in an env. to max. otion of cumulat. reward

# OR teaching AGENTS to behave in env. by telling it how good it's doing

# TRAINING MODEL: =>   DEEP Q LEARNING approach & extends REINFORCEMENT LEARNING ==>  PREDICTS ACTIONS in DEEP NEURAL NETWORK BY REWARDING QUALITY OF ACTION

# PySnake

# 3 Main Parts:   1. GAME  2. AGENT 3 .MODEL

# [1: GAME  ] =>  2D-game

# [2: MODEL ] =>  PyTorch:Linear_QNet DQN => Predicts ACTION

# [3: AGENT ] =>  Controls  GAME(S) & MODEL]

# TRAINING:    (exploring --> exploit)

# game.get_state(game) ~~> [STATE]     ~~>  game.get_move([STATE]) ~~>  [ACTION]   model.predict([ACTION])  ~~> [REWARD], [GAMEOVER], [SCORE]  ~~> game.play_step()
